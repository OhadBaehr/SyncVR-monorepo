# SyncVR: Remote Interpersonal Motor Synchronization (rIMS) System

## Project Overview

SyncVR is a Virtual Reality (VR) platform that enables **Remote Interpersonal Motor Synchronization (rIMS)**, aimed at fostering social connections and empathy in remote settings. By synchronizing movements between participants in VR, SyncVR investigates whether this affects feelings of closeness and empathy similar to in-person interactions.

## Key Features

- **Synchronized Movements**: SyncVR calculates and displays real-time synchronization levels between remote participants.
- **Research Tool**: Designed primarily for researchers to study the effects of rIMS on social connections.
- **Data Collection**: Provides intuitive, real-time feedback and collects data for analyzing empathy and closeness post-session.

## Folder Structure

- **syncvr-server**: Backend server handling APIs, database connections, and session management.
- **syncvr-unity**: Unity project that facilitates synchronization between participants and provides real-time feedback.
- **syncvr-front**: Front-end dashboard for managing research sessions and analyzing results.

SyncVR pushes the boundaries of remote communication by exploring the prosocial effects of synchronized movement in virtual spaces.
